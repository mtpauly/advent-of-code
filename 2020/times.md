## LEARNINGS

day5: stupid mistakes, not reading all the details
day6: not going slow enough, again stupid mistake
day7: mistakes in parsing and not knowing python set union syntax
day9: weird indexing mistakes, problem really wasn't that hard

day11: can take a deep breath-- making stupid mistakes costs more than going 10%
slower
day13: was no way to solve part 2 w/o knowning crt or googling
day14: wasn't thattt hard but poor reading comprehension hurt me a lot
